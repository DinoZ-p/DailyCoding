"""
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

"""
instead of creating a new string with only alphanumeric characters,
you can use two pointers to compare characters from the original string.
initialize one pointer at the beginning of the string and another pointer at the end of the string. 
then you can move the pointers towards each other, skipping any non-alphanumeric characters, 
and comparing the characters at the pointers.

if you find a mismatch, you can return false. 
if the pointers cross each other, you can return true.
